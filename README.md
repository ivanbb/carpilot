The project to create a system of automatic driving. At the moment, the possibilities are realized: holding on the lane and braking in front of cars. The system was tested on the Euro Trusk simulator 2. The OpenCV library is used to recognize the road markings. To drive a car, we used machine learning models. Car recognition is realized on neural networks and the Tensorflov library.
The project supports operating systems Linux and Windows.
The script for collecting dataset works only on Linux OS (you can run it on Windows, replacing libraries for working with a joystick and recording screen).
